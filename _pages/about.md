<h1 style="display:none;">Chang-Le (Charles) Chen – Researcher in Neuroscience, Medicine, Computation, and AI</h1>


#### Scientist + Engineer + AI enthusiast


Chang-Le (Charles) is a doctoral researcher in **Bioengineering** at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in **AI/ML**, **neuroimaging**, and **clinical neuroscience**. With experience as a research engineer at National Taiwan University College of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he integrates physics-based modeling, neuroimaging, and machine learning to uncover the mechanisms of **brain aging**, **neurological diseases**, and **psychiatric disorders**. His work focuses on developing scalable algorithms and quantitative biomarkers that bridge research and clinical practice. Driven to transform scientific innovation into real-world impact, Charles develops next-generation neuroimaging technologies and foundation AI systems to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes across the global healthcare and life sciences landscape.

#### Recent work:

My research focuses on, but is not limited to, the following topics:

- Developing statistical learning and harmonization frameworks to integrate neuroimaging and multi-site biomedical data, reducing site/pipeline bias and enabling large-scale analyses.

- Creating and validating neuroimaging-derived markers (structural, fluid-dynamics, functional) to detect aberrant brain physiology and pathology, especially in aging and neurological disorders.

- Building large-scale multimodal prediction paradigms and normative models using deep representation learning (integrating imaging, clinical, demographic, and AI/ML features) for early detection, prognosis, and individualized assessment across brain aging and disease.

- Designing scalable deep-learning pipelines for multi-site, multi-modal biomedical datasets (neuroimaging, genetics, clinical) that emphasize reproducible prototypes and translational readiness.

- Bridging interdisciplinary domains (mathematics, physics, neuroscience, AI) to develop foundation AI systems and agentic models in healthcare/life-sciences settings, advancing from algorithmic innovation to clinical workflow integration.
